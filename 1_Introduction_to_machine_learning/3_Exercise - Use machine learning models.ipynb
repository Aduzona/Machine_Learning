    "# Exercise: Using a Trained Model on New Data\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In Unit 3, we created a basic model that let us find the relationship between a dog's harness size and their boot size. We showed how this model could then be used to make a prediction about a new, previously unseen dog.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "It's common to build, train, then use a model while we are just learning about machine learning, but in the real world we don't want to train the model _every time_ we want to make a prediction.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Consider our avalanche dog equipment store scenario:\r\n",
    "* We want to train the model just once, then load that model onto the server that runs our online store. \r\n",
    "* Although the model is _trained_ on a dataset we downloaded from the internet, we actually want to _use_ it to estimate the boot size of our customers' dogs who are not in this dataset! \r\n",
