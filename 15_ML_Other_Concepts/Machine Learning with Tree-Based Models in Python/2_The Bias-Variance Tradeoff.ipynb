    "# The Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",

    "The bias-variance tradeoff is one of the fundamental concepts in supervised machine learning. In this chapter, you'll understand how to diagnose the problems of overfitting and underfitting. You'll also be introduced to the concept of ensembling where the predictions of several models are aggregated to produce predictions that are more robust.\n",

    "The diagram on the left here shows how the best model complexity corresponds to the lowest generalization error. When the model complexity increases, the variance increases while the bias decreases. Conversely, when model complexity decreases, variance decreases and bias increases. Your goal is to find the model complexity that achieves the lowest generalization error. Since this error is the sum of three terms with the irreducible error being constant, you need to find a balance between bias and variance because as one increases the other decreases. This is known as the bias-variance trade-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visually the diagram on the right, you can imagine approximating $\\hat f$ as aiming at the center of a shooting-target where the center is the true function $f$. If fhat is low bias and low variance, your shots will be closely clustered around the center. If $\\hat f$ is high variance and high bias, not only will your shots miss the target but they would also be spread all around the shooting target.\n",
