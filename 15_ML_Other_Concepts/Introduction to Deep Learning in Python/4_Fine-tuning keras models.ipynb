    "Model capacity is a model's ability to capture predictive patterns in your data. So, the more capacity a model, the further to the right we will be on this graph. If you had a network, and you increased the number of nodes or neurons in a hidden layer, that would increase model capacity. And if you add layers, that increases capacity. Said another way, making larger layers or increasing the number of layers moves you further to the right of this graph.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's walk through that process once. Here, I've started a model that has one hidden layer and $100$ units. That's a relatively simple, or low capacity, model. I get a mean squared error of $5.4$. Since I started with a simple model, I now try increasing capacity. I could increase the number of layers or use more hidden nodes. \n",
    "* I'll start by using more nodes in the one hidden layer. That improved the model, so I'll keep increasing capacity.\n",
    "* This time I'll switch to using 2 hidden layers. Each layer has 250 nodes. That improved the error more. \n",
    "* So, I try 3 layers, continuing to add capacity as long as it helps,This hurt the score. So, the model with 2 layers and 250 nodes is about perfect. I'll try another model that reduces capacity slightly from the last model I built.\n",
    "* That is 3 hidden layers with 200 nodes each. That seems the best model yet. So I'll stick with that. Should you change capacity by adding layers or by adding nodes to an existing layer? There isn't a universal answer to that. You can experiment. But you should generally be thinking about whether you are trying to increase or decrease capacity, ideally honing in on the right capacity by looking at validation scores.\n"
